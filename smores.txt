Using the Command Line

Git is best used on the command line. There are many different
graphical interfaces for Git, but they generally oversimplify Git and
make it more difficult to understand what is actually going on. The
best way to develop a deep understanding of how Git works is to use it
on the command line. As a result, this tutorial will not use any Git
GUIs, but solely use Git on the command line.

Before attending this tutorial, you should understand the basics of
how to use the command line on your operating system. Here is a basic
tutorial, if you are not already familiar with the command line. The
instructor will be using the command line on OS X to run examples, but
the examples should also run on the Windows command line with minimal
changes.

You will have the best experience if you use the zsh shell with the
oh-my-zsh framework installed, since it has Git integration
built-in. However, you can use whatever shell you choose, including
the default bash shell.
